# SolrConfigComparator

WIP! This is the start of a tool meant to compare two Solr config files
(generally one being the active one you might retrieve from the Solr server; the
other being the one you intend to be deployed on that server), in order to
assist with a health-check scenario by providing insight into which
solrconfig.xml is actually active.
